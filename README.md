# Minecraft Mod: Giant Sandworm

This repository is dedicated to learning and editing a mod for Minecraft that introduces a giant sandworm creature. This mod adds an exciting new element to the game, allowing players to interact with and experience the thrill of encountering a massive, procedurally animated sandworm.

## Features of the Giant Sandworm Mod

- **Dynamic Sandworm Behavior:** The sandworm moves procedurally, burrowing through the ground, emerging dynamically, and reacting to player presence.
- **Custom Textures and Models:** Unique design and animation to create a realistic and intimidating creature.
- **Integration with Minecraft Mechanics:** The sandworm interacts with existing game elements like blocks, mobs, and the environment.
- **Configurable Settings:** Customize the sandworm's size, behavior, and spawn rates.

## How the Mod Works

The sandworm mod is powered by a combination of procedural animation techniques and Minecraft's modding framework:

- **Procedural Movement:** The sandworm’s burrowing and surfacing animations are generated in real-time using trigonometric and physics-based algorithms.
- **Event-Driven Interactions:** The mod uses triggers to make the sandworm respond to specific in-game events, such as player proximity or environmental changes.
- **Custom AI:** Implements unique behavior patterns, including chasing players, avoiding certain blocks, and creating destruction zones.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Minecraft Forge or Fabric mod loader installed.
- Basic understanding of Java programming and Minecraft's modding API.
- Familiarity with 3D modeling tools (optional, for editing models).

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/giant-sandworm-mod.git
   ```
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
3. Build the mod using the mod loader’s tools (e.g., Forge Gradle for Forge mods).
4. Place the generated mod `.jar` file in the Minecraft `mods` folder.
5. Launch Minecraft and ensure the mod is loaded correctly.

### Editing the Mod

1. **Customize Animations:** Modify the sandworm’s procedural animation in the `SandwormAnimation.java` file.
2. **Adjust Behavior:** Edit the AI logic in the `SandwormAI.java` file to create unique movement and interaction patterns.
3. **Update Textures:** Replace textures in the `assets/sandworm/textures` folder for a fresh look.
4. **Test Changes:** Run the mod in a development environment to see your changes in action.

### Example Code Snippet
```java
public void moveSandworm() {
    double burrowDepth = Math.sin(System.currentTimeMillis() * 0.001) * MAX_DEPTH;
    this.setPosition(this.getX(), burrowDepth, this.getZ());
    this.rotateToMatchGround();
}
```

## Best Practices

- **Backup Your Work:** Always keep a backup of your changes to avoid losing progress.
- **Optimize Performance:** Procedural animations and AI logic can be computationally intensive, so use efficient algorithms.
- **Test Regularly:** Test changes in different environments to ensure compatibility and stability.
